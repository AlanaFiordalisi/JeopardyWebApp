Key Decisions:
* Random categories
* Disregard actual question values
    - The options vary so much over the course of decades
    - Difficult to know if you are guaranteed to get a set of questions with exaclty the right values

Getting Questions:
1. RNG from 0 to 18300 (which will be the offset param for the categories request)
2. Make /categories request with new offset
3. For each category, make request to /category
    a. Within that category, if "clues_count" > 5
        1. RNG from 0 to "clues_count" - 5 to select offset
        2. return "clues"[offset:offset + 5]
    b. if "clues_count" == 5
        1. return "clues"
    c. if "clues_count" < 5
        1. Make /categories request with new offset & retry

    ** Check that every returned clue has a question and an answer?

- /categories
    - count: 6
    - offset: 0 to 18300

- /category
    - id: each id from previous request
